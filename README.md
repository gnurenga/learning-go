## Learning Go

This repo will have pratice code which I am writing by Self Learning.

### Why I started Learning Go ?
Actually I am a Python Programmer, who love python for its simplicity.
Recently my focus area changed also towards Performance of application
which I am writing. We all know c/c++ is for performance. But I felt
developing code is a bit complex there. When I read the document of GO,
I felt it is simpler than c/c++, although it is not simple as python.

To acheive performance I decided to learn GO.
